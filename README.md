# Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains code for predicting stock prices using machine learning techniques, focusing on Tesla's stock as an example.

## Overview

The project aims to predict future stock prices by leveraging historical stock data and machine learning algorithms. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/shreeramdrao/Tesla-Stock-Prediction.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Tesla-Stock-Prediction
    ```

3. Install the required Python dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Run the `Tesla stock price prediction.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to preprocess the data, including cleaning, feature engineering, and formatting.

2. **Model Training:** Train machine learning models using the prepared data. The notebook includes code for training a linear regression model.

3. **Visualization:** Visualize historical stock prices, predicted values, and model performance using the `Tesla stock price prediction.ipynb` notebook.
